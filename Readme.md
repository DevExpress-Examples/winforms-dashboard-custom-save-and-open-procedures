# How to Override Save and Load Procedures in Dashboard Designer

This example demonstrates how to implement custom save and open procedures in Dashboard Designer.

The application handles the [DashboardOpening](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardDesigner.DashboardOpening) and [DashboardSaving](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardDesigner.DashboardSaving) events to open/save the dashboard located at the path defined in code.

Run the application and click the **File -> Open** button to load the dashboard from the file specified in code. Make any changes and click **File -> Save** to save changes to the same file.
